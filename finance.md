## Covered Call (Buy-Write) long stock + short call
**Naked Call** means you short a call without underlying asset, which is highly risky while profit is higher as well. But if you are not so sure about this bearish, you can use **Covered Call** to lower risk with more stable profit.

Covered Call and Buy-Write are same strategy but different timing. They both involving owning certain underlying asset, and you sell a call option on it (*This originally means bearish, but once you own the underlying asset instead of sell it naked, that means neutral or slightly bullish*)

If you already hold the underlying stock, and then you sell a call option, which is **Covered Call**. 
If you buy the stock and sell the call option simultaneously, which is **Buy-Write**.

***They are exactly the same strategy.***

The biggest loss of CC is not Forced liquidation, but your opportunity cost (you miss an opportunity of big increase)
### *Example*
You own one underlying stock: $100

Strike price of the call: $110

Premium: \$10

**Short Call Payoff = $C - \max(0, S_T - K)$**

If the stock price drop to \$0 ($S_T = 0$), 
the buyer will not exercise,  
you gain \$10 ($C$) premium and \$100 loss in stock,  
option payoff is $C - \max(0, 0 - 110) = 10 - 0 = +\$10$,  
so your total loss is \$100 - \$10 = \$90.

If the stock price rise to \$200 ($S_T = 200$),  
the buyer will exercise,  
as the seller it is your obligation to sell it at K = \$110, your option payoff is $10 - \max(0, 200 - 110) = 10 - 90 = +-\$80$, 
so your total profit = \$100 + (-\$80) = \$20

| Stock Price | Option Payoff | Stock Payoff | Total P&L |

| $0         | +$10          | â€“$100         | **â€“$90**  |

| $110        | +$10          | +$10         | **+$20**  |
| $120        | +$10          | +$10 there is more profit for buyer but not for you        | **+$20**  |

## Protected Put (Married Put) Long stock + long put
You own stock (or just bought it) at $S_0$.
You buy a put option (strike $K$, premium $P$).
The put gives you the right to sell the stock at $K$.
So if the stock falls, the putâ€™s value rises â†’ your loss is limited.
If the stock rises, you keep the upside minus the cost of the put premium.

Protected Put means you already own asset, Married Put means you will need to buy it, but they are same strategy.

### *Example*
You own one underlying stock: **\$100**

Strike price of the put: **\$95**  
Premium: **\$5**

**Long Put Payoff =  max(0, $K âˆ’ S_T$) âˆ’ $P$**

If the stock price rises to **\$150 ($S_T = 150$)**,  
the buyer (you) will not exercise the put,  
so the option payoff is ` max(0, 95 âˆ’ 150) âˆ’ 5 = 0 âˆ’ 5 = â€“$5 `. 

Your stock gains `150 âˆ’ 100 = +$50`.  
â†’ **Total profit = +\$50 âˆ’ \$5 = +\$45.**

If the stock price drops to **\$50 ($S_T = 50$)**,  
you will exercise the put and sell the stock at \$95,  
so the option payoff is `$max(0, 95 âˆ’ 50) âˆ’ 5 = 45 âˆ’ 5 = +\$40`.  
Your stock loss is `50 âˆ’ 100 = â€“\$50`.  
â†’ **Total = â€“\$50 + \$40 = â€“\$10 (max loss).**

| **Stock Price** | **Option Payoff (Put)** | **Stock Payoff** | **Total P&L** |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| $0   | +$90 â€“ $5 = +$85 | â€“$100 | **â€“$15** |
| $50  | +$45 â€“ $5 = +$40 | â€“$50  | **â€“$10** |
| $80  | +$15 â€“ $5 = +$10 | â€“$20  | **â€“$10** |
| $95  | +$0 â€“ $5 = â€“$5  | â€“$5   | **â€“$10** |
| $100 | â€“$5 | $0 | **â€“$5** |
| $120 | â€“$5 | +$20 | **+$15** |
| $150 | â€“$5 | +$50 | **+$45** |

âœ… **Maximum loss = â€“$10 (â‰ˆ put premium + price gap if K < Sâ‚€)**  
âœ… **Unlimited profit potential = as stock rises**
