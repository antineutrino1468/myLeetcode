## Covered Call (Buy-Write) long stock + short call
**Naked Call** means you short a call without underlying asset, which is highly risky while profit is higher as well. But if you are not so sure about this bearish, you can use **Covered Call** to lower risk with more stable profit.

Covered Call and Buy-Write are same strategy but different timing. They both involving owning certain underlying asset, and you sell a call option on it (*This originally means bearish, but once you own the underlying asset instead of sell it naked, that means neutral or slightly bullish*)

If you already hold the underlying stock, and then you sell a call option, which is **Covered Call**. 
If you buy the stock and sell the call option simultaneously, which is **Buy-Write**.

***They are exactly the same strategy.***
### *Example*
You own one underlying stock: $100

Strike price of the call: $110

Premium: \$10

**Short Call Payoff = $C - \max(0, S_T - K)$**

If the stock price drop to \$0 ($S_T = 0$), 
the buyer will not exercise,  
you gain \$10 ($C$) premium and \$100 loss in stock,  
option payoff is $C - \max(0, 0 - 110) = 10 - 0 = +\$10$,  
so your total loss is \$100 - \$10 = \$90.

If the stock price rise to \$200 ($S_T = 200$),  
the buyer will exercise,  
as the seller it is your obligation to sell it at K = \$110, your option payoff is $C10 - \max(0, 200 - 110) = 10 - 90 = +-\$80$, 
so your total profit = \$100 + (-\$80) = \$20

| $110        | +$10          | +$10         | **+$20**  |
